# Intro

Discord chats are a great resource for interacting and learning from others on subjects not just related to gaming.

# Why

I wanted to learn more about building apps at scale, but wanted a subject matter intersting to me.

There's a meme about how nobody's ever visited the Stackoverflow homepage, since they're typically directed to stackoverflow from Google, so I decided to build something which could be indexed by search engines.

# discord-mirror

Discord-mirror is a Discord bot which can be added to guilds and enabled on a channel-by-channel basis. Enabling the bot within a channel queues all the messages in that channel to be downloaded and posted to discord-mirror.

# Implications

- Costs
  - Front end has a space for ads to try and support the infra costs
- Probably some terms of use violations
- Might be populate for LLM scrapers
- ... will add
